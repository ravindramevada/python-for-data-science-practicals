 2. Center align
 3. Remove all the special characters
 4. Convert numbers to string (e.g. 1 to one)
 ``` 
**7.** Write a program to perform addition on two lists and print it in third. [ðŸ”—](https://ravindramevada.github.io/python-for-data-science-practicals/#Practical---07) \
**8.** Write a program to read a string and print a number of unique characters from the string using the set. [ðŸ”—](https://ravindramevada.github.io/python-for-data-science-practicals/#Practical---08) \
**9.** Write a program to check if elements exist in a tuple or not. [ðŸ”—](https://ravindramevada.github.io/python-for-data-science-practicals/#Practical---09) \
**10.** Create function word_occur which takes a string as an argument and returns a dictionary where keys are words of the string and values are the occurrence of each word in the string. [ðŸ”—](https://ravindramevada.github.io/python-for-data-science-practicals/#Practical---10) \
**11.** Create a class called Shape, which has three subclasses say Triangle, Rectangle, Circle. Define one method area()in the shape class and override this area() in these three subclasses to calculate for specific objects i.e., area() of the Triangle subclass should calculate the area of a triangle, etc. Same for Rectangle and Circle.
